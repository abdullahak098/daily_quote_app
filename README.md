Technologies Used in Daily Quote App

Based on the pubspec.yaml file, the following technologies and dependencies are used in this Flutter project:

Core Technologies

•
Flutter: The UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

•
Dart: The programming language used by Flutter.

Dependencies (from pubspec.yaml)

State Management

•
provider: ^6.1.1 (A popular state management solution for Flutter).

Local Storage

•
shared_preferences: ^2.5.3 (For persisting simple data on the device).

Quote Sharing

•
share_plus: ^7.2.1 (For sharing content from the app).

Local Notifications

•
flutter_local_notifications: ^17.1.2 (For displaying local notifications).

UI/Styling

•
google_fonts: ^6.2.1 (For using Google Fonts in the application).

Development Dependencies

•
flutter_test: (Flutter's testing framework).

•
flutter_lints: ^4.0.0 (A set of recommended lints to encourage good coding practices).

Additional Technologies and Services (from Source Code Analysis)

Backend Services

•
Firebase: Used for authentication (firebase_auth) and potentially other backend services like Firestore (though not explicitly seen in pubspec.yaml, its presence with authentication suggests its use). The main.dart file shows Firebase.initializeApp() which is a core Firebase setup.

Authentication Methods

•
Email and Password Authentication: Implemented using firebase_auth.

•
Google Sign-In: Integrated using google_sign_in and firebase_auth.

•
Phone Number Authentication (OTP/SMS): Implemented using firebase_auth's verifyPhoneNumber and PhoneAuthProvider.credential.

Platform-Specific Considerations

•
kIsWeb: Used to differentiate between web and mobile/desktop platforms for Firebase initialization and Google Sign-In, indicating cross-platform development.

Architecture/Patterns

•
Provider Pattern: Used for state management, as indicated by the provider package and ChangeNotifierProvider in main.dart.

Other Utilities

•
NotificationService: A custom service (likely built within the project) that utilizes flutter_local_notifications for handling notifications.

•
ThemeProvider: A custom utility (likely built within the project) that utilizes provider for managing application themes.
